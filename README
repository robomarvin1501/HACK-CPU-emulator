This is an emulator, which will hopefully eventually replace the emulators provided in the nand2tetris course.
I personally found the Java emulators to be functional, though slow, with many UI problems
generally linked to the age of the emulator's code. The new web emulators were a non-functional
mess when I tried to use them. This will hopefully provide a reasonable substitute when it is done.

Currently most basic functionality is complete, in that the emulator can read ASM
code, and run it. However, there is currently no GUI, no testing, and no debugging
capabilities. These will be added with time. Also, there are some speed optimisations
to be done.

Another change is that I have added the shift commands found in some variations
of the course, since what computer doesn't have those? Feel free not
to use them. I will possibly add the option to disable those... later.
