This is an emulator, which will hopefully eventually provide an optional
replacement the emulators provided in the nand2tetris course.
I personally found the Java emulators to be functional, though slow, with many UI problems
generally linked to the age of the emulator's code. The new web emulators were a non-functional
mess when I tried to use them. This will hopefully provide a reasonable substitute when it is done.

Currently, the emulator can run ASM code (lightly tested, not thoroughly), and display with the GUI the happenings
inside the emulator, along with displaying to the screen. The GUI still needs improvement in terms of layout, and
debugging controls still need to be added.

Another change is that I have added the shift commands found in some variations
of the course, since what computer doesn't have those? Feel free not
to use them. I will possibly add the option to disable those... later.
